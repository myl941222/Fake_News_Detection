# Fake_news_detection

-  Use matplotlib, seaborn to visualize the data.
-  Download nltk and import stopwords for performing data clearning.
-  Use wordcloud to create image for real and fake text
-  Import tensorflow keras for Tokenizer, pad_sequences and sequential
-  Create LSTM model, fit and train the model by using train dataset.
-  Create GRU model, fit and train the model by using train dataset.
-  Calculate the accuracy score for both training dataset and test dataset for both LSTM modeel and GRU model.
-  change the embedding size for both models to find the difference.
